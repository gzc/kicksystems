# Virtual Memory

**MMU** : Performing the translation of virtual memory addresses to physical addresses. It is usually implemented as part of the central processing unit (CPU).

**TLB** : A translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is a memory cache that stores recent translations of virtual memory to physical addresses for faster retrieval.

**Page Fault** : A page fault (sometimes called #PF or PF) is a type of interrupt, called trap, raised by computer hardware when a running program accesses a memory page that is mapped into the virtual address space, but not actually loaded into main memory.

**Multi-Level Page Tables : ** Imaging by yourself.
