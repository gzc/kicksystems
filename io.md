File Descriptor

Each process created by a Unix shell begins life with three open files: standard input (descriptor 0), standard output (descriptor 1), and standard error (descriptor 2). 

##Sharing Files
* **Descriptor table**. Each process has its own separate descriptor table whose entries are indexed by the processâ€™s open file descriptors. Each open descriptor entry points to an entry in the file table.
* **File table**. The set of open files is represented by a file table that is shared by all processes. Each file table entry consists of (for our purposes) the current file position, a reference count of the number of descriptor entries that currently point to it, and a pointer to an entry in the v-node table. Closing a descriptor decrements the reference count in the associated file table entry. The kernel will not delete the file table entry until its reference count is zero.
* **v-node table**. Like the file table, the v-node table is shared by all processes. Each entry contains most of the information in the stat structure, including the st_mode and st_size members.
